## Intro
This app was developed to visualize the historic groundwater levels for a set of actively monitored wells in the Pecos Valley/Artesia region.  The main data source powering this application is [New Mexico Water Data Initiative's](https://newmexicowaterdata.org) SensorThing API (see [https://st2.newmexicowaterdata.org/FROST-Server/v1.1](https://st2.newmexicowaterdata.org/FROST-Server/v1.1))
